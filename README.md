This repository consists templates of some of the commonly used Data structures and Algorithms used in Competitive Programming competitions.

The codes only contains the required functions, or in some places classes/struct, which are required for the given problem. Header files and main functions are avoided unless required for explanantion. Complexity of every function is explained alongside with it.

Some of the programs/implementations have been written by me, others have been modified/copied from some sources or internet. In most of the cases the source has been mentioned too.
